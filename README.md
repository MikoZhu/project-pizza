## The problem
At the begnning, I did not immediatey recognize the data type. My approach involved using the "typeof" method to initially inspect the data. Subsequently, I utilized consol.log(typeof) method to address the issue at hand. During the debugging process, I consistently printed the results incrementally, allowing me to analyze the code's behavior at each step.
